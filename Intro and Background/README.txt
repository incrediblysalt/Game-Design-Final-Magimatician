Welcome to the Intro and Background file, which contains assets used in the introduction sequence and background elements.
Each of these elements were created using the online pixel art creator, piskelapp.com.

The intro sequence both displays our group name, [INSERT GROUP NAME HERE], and a fade in to the dungeon which Magimatician explores in the game.

The press any key to start image was saved to make creating the bakcground assets a little easier. The background looping and background still assets were used alongside the intro sequence, with the loop playing until the player presses a key to start the game. This is the same for the magimatican fade in shot, as each part was created separately before being compiled together.

The Izac shop and Wilhem shop assets were backgrounds created for NPCs within the game, both of which I worked on diligently to reflect the character personality while still remaining quite similar.
