Welcome to the UI file, which contains the assets used to display information to the player as part of the user interface.
Each of these elements were created using the online pixel art creator, piskelapp.com.

Most of these files were worked on by my other group members, however I did create a few myself.

The scroll and scroll updated animations demonstrate the dialoge box, which was designed to look like a scroll, and has a button for advancing the dialoge forwards and backwards, along with entering into a menu in the middle button if the player were at a shop.

The spell slots simple was designed to sit at the top of the screen, displaying which spells were available to the player and which number key was associated with them in the blue box. The purple box was left open for the calculated numbers the player would need to solve for when fighting monsters in each level.
