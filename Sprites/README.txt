Welcome to the Sprites file, which contains the assets used for the player and other NPCs in the game, including animated elements such as walk animations and spells used by the Magimatician.
Each of these elements were created using the online pixel art creator, piskelapp.com.

All of these designs and animations were completed by other members of my team.
