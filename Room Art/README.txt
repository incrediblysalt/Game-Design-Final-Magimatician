Welcome to the Room Art file, which contains assets used in the room design of the game, including initial designs and redesigns until we reached a design which we liked.
Each of these elements were created using the online pixel art creator, piskelapp.com.

All the room designs were done by me personally, as I adjusted them for better quality and allowed for looping to be used by our coder in the game.
