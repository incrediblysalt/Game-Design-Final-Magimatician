Welcome to Magimatican, a fun game designed for kids as part of a Game Design course. My group and I worked hard on each part of this project, so read on to learn more about what is in these files!

The Game, Pitch, and Review file contains all of our documents the teacher wanted us to submit, including a game pitch for our design and check-up documents to make sure our work is being done.

The Intro and Background file contains important assets for the fade in sequence of the game, along with a few background elements to highlight.

The Room Art file contains the pixel art for the rooms, including previous iterations until our group found a final design which we liked.

The Sprites file contains, if you couldn't tell, the art for the sprites used within the game.

The UI file, unsurprisingly, contains the UI elements found around the screen to display information for the player.

And finally, there's magimatician.exe, the actual game file. NOTE: we created this game using GameMaker Studio 2, which is necessary to have downloaded in order to properly run the executable file.
